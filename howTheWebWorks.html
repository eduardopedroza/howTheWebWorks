1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that allows communication between web servers and web clients
2. URL (Uniform Resource Loader) is an adress that uniquely identifies a resource on the internet
3. DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that serves as a directory that helps in the navigation of the internet by
   providing mapping between domain names
4. A query string is used to declare key value pairs at the end of a url, generally to specify what recources 
   should be used in that URL
5. Two commonly used HTTP verbs are GET and POST. The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server but not modify it.
   The POST method is used to submit and make changes to the server
6. An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server using the HTTP. Includes an HTTP verb, the target url
   and the HTTP version being used.
7. An HTTP response is the servers way of communicating the outcome of the HTTP request
8. An HTTP header is part of an HTTP request that contains additional information about the request or response
   Some examples I've seen are catch-control and content-type
9. There is a huge process but the main events that occur when you type a url into  browser is the following:
    - HTTP request
    - HTTP response
    - Page load
